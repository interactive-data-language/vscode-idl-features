# IDL for VSCode: Features

This repository is meant to track feature ideas and work for GitHub projects to track overall progress towards goals and give some insights into the work that we are thinking about doing for the extension.

Keeping this separate from the official repository so the ideas we have don't make the actual project look like it is full of bugs :)

If you have bugs/feature requests for IDL for VSCode, please use the official repository [here](https://github.com/interactive-data-language/vscode-idl)
